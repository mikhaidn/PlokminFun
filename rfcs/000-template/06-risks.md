- Specific scenario where this could happen
- Consequences if it does

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Preventive measure 1
- ✅ Preventive measure 2

**Contingency plan:**
- What to do if it happens anyway
- How to recover

## Rollback Plan

**If things go wrong, how do we roll back?**

**Rollback steps:**
1. Step to revert changes
2. How to restore previous state
3. How to notify users (if needed)

**Rollback criteria:**
- When to trigger rollback
- Who makes the decision
- How quickly can we roll back
