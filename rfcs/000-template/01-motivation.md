# Motivation

**Why are we doing this?**

---

## Current State

Describe the current situation:
- What's the problem?
- What pain points exist?
- What's not working well?

---

## User Impact

How does this affect users?
- What can't they do today?
- What's frustrating or confusing?
- What opportunities are we missing?

---

## Developer Impact

How does this affect developers?
- What's hard to maintain?
- What's duplicated or inconsistent?
- What's blocking future work?

---

## Metrics

Quantify the problem if possible:
- Performance issues (slow, resource-heavy)
- Code duplication (lines, files affected)
- User complaints (bug reports, feedback)
- Technical debt (complexity, test coverage)

---

## Why Now?

Why is this the right time to address this?
- What changed recently?
- What dependencies exist?
- What's the urgency?

---

**Goal:** Keep this section ≤100 lines. Focus on the "why" not the "how" (that's in solution.md).
