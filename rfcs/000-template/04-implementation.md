# Implementation Plan

**How will we build this?**

**Note:** If this section grows >200 lines, split it into a subdirectory:
```bash
mkdir 04-implementation
mv 04-implementation.md 04-implementation/README.md
# Create phase files
touch 04-implementation/phase-1.md
touch 04-implementation/phase-2.md
```
