# CardGames Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-24
**Current Status:** RFC-005 planning complete, unified game builder path defined

---

## Product Strategy

### Vision
Build the best collection of classic card games on the web - mobile-first, accessible, and delightful.

### Current Focus
**Phase: RFC-005 - Unified Game Builder**

We have TWO working games (FreeCell and Klondike), a monorepo architecture, shared component library, and comprehensive accessibility features. RFC-003 Phase 2 (card backs) is complete with RFC-005 compatibility.

**Strategic pivot:** Instead of adding features to individual games, we're investing in a unified game builder system (RFC-005) that will make adding new games take <1 day instead of 3-4 days, and allow UI improvements to benefit all games at once.

### 🚀 P5: RFC-005 Unified Game Builder (Current)
**Goal:** Create config-driven game builder for rapid game development

**Why this now:**
- Adding new games currently takes 3-4 days (1200+ lines of duplicated code)
- UI improvements must be implemented separately for each game
- Strong foundation in place (70-75% toward unified builder already)
- RFC-003 Phase 2 implemented with RFC-005 compatibility patterns

**Strategic Impact:**
- New games: 3-4 days → <1 day
- UI improvements: Apply once, benefit all games
- Code duplication: Reduced by 70%
- New game (Spider): ~150 lines of config vs 1200+ lines of code

**Phase 1: UI Prototype** (Week 1, 2-3 days) ⬅️ CURRENT
- [ ] Day 1: Animation experiments
  - Card drag with spring physics (framer-motion or react-spring)
  - Card flip animation (3D rotateY)
  - Win celebration (confetti + cascade)
- [ ] Day 2: Mobile interactions
  - Smart tap-to-move (auto-execute if 1 valid move, highlight if multiple)
  - Test on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, iPad
  - Validate 60fps performance, touch target sizes (44x44px min)
- [ ] Day 3: Documentation
  - Create docs/architecture/ui-requirements.md
  - Document animation callbacks, component lifecycle hooks
  - Performance requirements (60fps, <100ms touch response)

**Phase 2: Unification** (Weeks 2-5)
- [ ] Week 2: Standardize move execution
  - Define GameActions<TState> interface
  - Create createMoveExecutor() helper
  - Migrate Klondike and FreeCell to GameActions
- [ ] Week 3: Create game config system
  - Define GameConfig<TState> interface
  - Create game factory (createGame())
  - Build config files for existing games
- [ ] Weeks 4-5: Generic components
  - GenericGameBoard, GenericTableau
  - Migrate both games to use generic components

**Phase 3: Perfect UI** (Weeks 6-10)
- [ ] Animation system integration
- [ ] Smart tap-to-move implementation
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader)
- [ ] Unified settings modal
- [ ] Theme system

**Validation** (Week 11)
- [ ] Build Spider Solitaire in <1 day to validate system

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ All existing tests pass after migration
- ✅ Spider built in <1 day using new system
- ✅ Zero regressions in existing games
- ✅ 60fps animations on mid-range devices

### 🎯 P6: User Retention
**Goal:** Keep users coming back by saving their progress

**Why this next:**
- Users lose progress when refreshing = frustration
- Basic expectation for modern web apps
- Enables "Continue" vs "New Game" UX pattern
- Foundation for daily challenges later

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Game Persistence** (4-6 hours)
  - Auto-save to localStorage on each move
  - Restore game on page reload
  - "Continue" vs "New Game" dialog on startup
  - Handle localStorage quota exceeded gracefully
  - Implement for both FreeCell and Klondike
  - Add tests for save/restore logic
  - See: localStorage best practices in web APIs

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Game state persists across page reloads
- ✅ Users can continue interrupted games
- ✅ Graceful handling of storage errors
- ✅ Works offline (PWA + localStorage)

---

### 📊 P7: Analytics & Understanding Users
**Goal:** Understand how users play to make informed decisions

**Why this next:**
- Currently flying blind - no data on usage
- Need to understand device distribution (mobile vs desktop)
- Need completion rates to validate difficulty
- Informs future feature priorities
- Privacy-first approach builds trust

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Privacy-First Analytics** (2-3 hours)
  - Add Plausible or Simple Analytics (privacy-focused)
  - Track events: games_started, games_won, games_lost, undo_used, hint_used
  - Track properties: game_type (freecell/klondike), mode (draw1/draw3), device_type
  - No personal data, no cookies, GDPR-compliant
  - Add to both games
  - Document in CLAUDE.md

- [ ] **Basic Metrics Dashboard** (1-2 hours)
  - Set up Plausible dashboard
  - Define key metrics: DAU, completion rate, avg moves, device breakdown
  - Share read-only dashboard link (optional)

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Analytics tracking games played
- ✅ Device type distribution visible
- ✅ Completion rates measurable
- ✅ Zero PII collected

---

### 🚀 P8: Daily Challenge & Social (Future)
**Goal:** Convert casual visitors into daily users

**Why later:**
- Need game persistence first (P6)
- Need analytics first to measure impact (P7)
- Daily challenge is high-effort, high-reward
- Focus on core experience before growth mechanics

**Tasks (Future):**
- [ ] **Daily Challenge** (8-12 hours)
  - Generate daily seed from UTC date
  - Track completion status in localStorage
  - Show streak counter
  - Persist streak across page loads
  - Same seed for all players globally
  - See: Wordle-style sharing format

- [ ] **Social Sharing** (2-3 hours)
  - Share game results (seed, moves, win/loss)
  - Copy link to clipboard
  - Native share API on mobile
  - Format: "I won FreeCell #12345 in 87 moves! 🎉"
  - Include daily challenge branding

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Daily active users (DAU) > 10
- ✅ Return rate > 20%
- ✅ Social shares tracked in analytics
- ✅ Daily challenge completion rate > 50%

---

## Anti-Priorities (What NOT to Do Yet)

### ❌ Don't Build Backend/Accounts Yet
- **Why not:** Adds complexity, costs money, no proven demand
- **When:** After 1000+ daily users or when localStorage limits are hit

### ❌ Don't Build Leaderboards Yet
- **Why not:** Requires backend, moderation, anti-cheat
- **When:** After daily challenge has proven engagement

### ❌ Don't Add Flip Animations Yet
- **Why not:** RFC-003 Phases 3-4, defer until card backs are integrated
- **When:** After RFC-003 Phase 2 complete and analytics show user engagement

### ❌ Don't Optimize Bundle Size Yet
- **Why not:** Both games are small (~200KB each), no performance issues
- **When:** Only if metrics show slow load times

### ❌ Don't Build Game #3 (Spider) Yet
- **Why not:** Focus on polishing existing 2 games first
- **When:** After analytics show strong engagement and daily challenges are live

### ✅ Already Done - Don't Redo
- ✅ ~~Extract Libraries~~ - @cardgames/shared exists (#21)
- ✅ ~~Build Second Game~~ - Klondike is live (#19)
- ✅ ~~Mobile Optimization~~ - Accessibility settings handle this
- ✅ ~~Undo/Redo~~ - useGameHistory hook is implemented (#16)

## Decision Log

### 2025-12-23: Monorepo Complete - Focus on User Growth
**Decision:** With monorepo, 2 games, and shared library complete, shift focus to user retention and analytics
**Rationale:** Technical foundation is solid. Now need to understand users and keep them engaged.
**Trade-off:** Delays flip animations and game #3, but prioritizes sustainable growth.

### 2025-12-23: Defer Flip Animations (RFC-003 Phase 3-4)
**Decision:** Complete card backs integration (Phase 2) but defer flip animations until analytics show demand
**Rationale:** Card backs are functional requirement for Klondike. Animations are polish that can wait.
**Trade-off:** Less visual polish short-term, but faster delivery of persistence and analytics.

### 2025-12-22: Build Klondike and Extract Libraries - COMPLETED ✅
**Decision:** Built Klondike (#19) and extracted shared library (#21)
**Outcome:** Successful! Monorepo setup validated architecture. Shared components working well.
**Learning:** Rule of three was right - needed 2 games to know what to abstract.

### 2025-12-22: Prioritize Mobile First - COMPLETED ✅
**Decision:** Focus on PWA + mobile optimization before building game #2
**Outcome:** PWA configured, accessibility settings provide mobile optimization.
**Learning:** Accessibility settings (card sizing, touch targets) solved mobile UX more elegantly than breakpoints.

### 2025-12-22: Skip Backend for Now - STILL VALID ✅
**Decision:** Use localStorage for all persistence, no backend yet
**Rationale:** No proven demand, adds complexity and cost, localStorage sufficient for thousands of users.
**Status:** Continuing with localStorage for persistence (P6) and daily challenges (P8 future).
